# CNN-SVM-Medicinal-Leaf-Identification
This repository implements a hybrid SVM-CNN model for medicinal leaf identification, combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.
#  Methodology
### Feature Extraction using CNN
A pretrained CNN model extracts deep features from leaf images.    
### Feature Flattening & Dimensionality Reduction  
Extracted features are flattened and optionally reduced using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)  
### Classification using SVM
The processed features are fed into an SVM classifier for final classification.  
# Dataset
The dataset consists of segmented medicinal leaf images:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/riteshranjansaroj/segmented-medicinal-leaf-images  
# Key Features
✅ Hybrid Model: CNN for feature extraction, SVM for classification.  
✅ Pretrained Networks: Uses models  for better feature learning.  
✅ High Accuracy: Achieves better performance than traditional CNN classifiers.  
✅ Performance Metrics: Evaluates Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.  
✅ Scalable & Flexible: Can be adapted to new datasets with minimal changes.
